# Plant Scheduling
This was the code behind my honours dissertation, the abstract for my report is below. The bug folder contains reproduction of a bug I found in JuMP. The constraintProgramming folder contains files for that approach with its own README. The src folder contains all the functions and helper functions for running the MIP solution. The example folder contains solve.jl that simplifies the proccess of running the code.

# Abstract
There are mainly two types of industrial resource production plants, namely continuous production plants and batch processing plants, each requiring distinct scheduling techniques. Batch processing offers  flexibility  in  product  customisation,  whereas  continuous  production  plants  prioritise efficiency  and  minimal  downtime. Constraint  programming  and  mixed  integer  programming (MIP) are both suitable methods for modelling batch processing plants however for continuous production plants, constraint programming is held back by its software implementation.  

Recent developments in IBMâ€™s constraint programming solver have brought it up to par with MIP approaches and it is of interest as to whether constraint programming can now be used to accurately model continuous production plants. 

Within this report I propose a new modelling function for constraint programming that would allow for accurate modelling of continuous production plants. I also discuss insights into modelling strategies within the current limitations, and how batch processing models could be adapted to work for continuous production.  

Regarding  MIP,  I  propose  a  generalised  discrete-time  evolution-based  model  for  scheduling continuous production plants and I evaluate the impact of various heuristic techniques on the model's feasibility, schedule quality, and run-time performance. 


## How to Use
### Solve Parameters
for each solve you can specificy the parameters, and options you want to use: <br />

const DATA_PATH::String = "the folder path of JSONs" <br />
const MAX_ITER::Int64 =  50 # max number of itterations <br />
const MAX_TIME = 60 # seconds (this is per solve) <br />
const TOL::Float64 = 0.0001 # maximum tolerance for convergence <br />
const SOLVES::Int64 = 2 # how mant time windows you want to solve <br />
const SOLVE_PERIOD::Int64 = 36 # time points (easier to thank as hours) <br />
const LOCK_PERIOD::Int64 = 24 # time points (easier to thank as hours) <br />
const PERIOD_INCREMENT::Float64 = 1 # time points (easier to thank as hours) <br />
const RECORD_SOLVES::Bool = true # output each solve to an excel <br />
const RECORD_ITTR::Bool = false # output each itteration to an excel <br />
const RECORD_TIMINGS::Bool = false # output timings of each itteration to excel <br />
const PRINT_ITTERATIONS::Bool = true # output itterations to console <br /> 
const USE_CONVERGENCE::Bool = true # decision whether to use convergence or not <br />
const USE_COLUMN_AGE = true # decision whether to use column ageing or not <br />
const AMOUNT_TO_FIX = 1  # amount of infeasible states to fix per itteration of the hueristic <br />


### Data Structure
The data folder contains different plant setups, formatted as 4 JSONs for ingestition into the model <br />
there are 4 JSONs used to describe a plant are: deliveries, machines, resources, and states. <br />

For deliveres the JSON is formatted 
```json
{
  "storage_resource_name": {
    "time_ppoint": x, (the time point at whichs this volume change should happen)
    "volume": x
  }
}
```

For Machines the JSON is formatted
```json
{
  "machine_name": {
    "initial_state": "off",
    "initial_time": 0, (in time points)
    "run_time": 8, (in time points)
    "cleaning_time": 3, (in time points)
    "min_off_time": 0, (in time points)
    "max_off_time": 3, (in time points)
    "rates": [-51, 42.5], (rate applied to each silo contained in flows)
    "flows": ["silo1", "silo2"] (which silos this machine interacts with),
    "cleaning_group": "cleaner1" (which cleaner subgroup this machine belongs to)
  }
}
```


For Resources the JSON is formatted
```json
{
  "resource_name": {
    "min_capacity": 0,
    "max_capacity": 999999,
    "initial_volume": 500,
    "rates": [], (applicable for cleaners, indicates how much cleaning resource a machine uses)
    "type": "storage",
    "flows": [] (applicable for cleaner resources indicating which machine belongs to this cleaner)
  }
}
```



For States the JSON is formatted
```json
{
  "state_name": {
    "next_state": "state_name",
    "duration_type": "xxxx", (whether the duration type is random or fixed)
    "min_duration_key": "xxxx", (The parameter on machines that indicates the max duration)
    "max_duration_key": , (the parameter on machines that indicates the min duration, only used in random schedul generation)
    "include": true (whether this state is to be considered used or the cycling of states)
  }
}
```
